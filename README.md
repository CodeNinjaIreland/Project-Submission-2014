CodeNinja Project Submission 
=========================================

The deadline for project submissions is at __Noon, Friday January 31st, 2014__ - [fill in this form to submit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1N9kaNZEVxVHSttgTiY29aBZkoJ4gzxTvkEkm_TYj7Nc/viewform)


## What you submit

A project submission should contain some / all of the following (depending on your project):

- The source-code for your app (which should be hosted in a Git repository on GitHub, Bitbucket, or similar)
- If you need a private repository for your project, [fill in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1joqaFoLPGOLLO5CTj3c5nx1AXiDUIUlbW50W0o-A074/viewform) and we'll set you up with a CodeNinja one (you'll still need a GitHub account)
- A file called README.md in the root of the repository that tells us about your app. You could include details such as:
	- The names & contact details of your team
	- Some background to the app idea
	- Who the potential audience is
	- Who you're competing with
	- Where we find a demo of your app (this could be a link to a web version, or instructions on how we can run a demo if it's a mobile app)
	- Any other details about the project you think we should know


## IMPORTANT

If your code is in a private repository, __be sure to add us as users__ so we can see it!! If it's hosted on GitHub, you can use our GitHub usernames, otherwise, use the email accounts.
